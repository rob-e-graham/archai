# ARCHAI™
## Sovereign Semantic Heritage Infrastructure

> *"Museums are not silent repositories of Memory — they are living, thinking organisms, where imagination and knowledge, tradition and innovation meet. They are spaces where the past is not only preserved but reborn, where every visitor becomes part of a continuous human conversation."*
> — Gayane Umerova, UNESCO Global Dialogue on AI and the Future of Museums, 2025

**ARCHAI** (Augmented Reanimation, Cultural Heritage, Artificial Intelligence) is a sovereign, open-source-method AI toolkit for cultural institutions and artist-run spaces. It layers conversational AI onto collection objects using local language models, vector semantic search, and AUX.IO visitor interfaces (deployable via NFC, QR, hyperlink, or beacon) — with all computation running on locally-owned hardware and collection data never leaving the institution's physical infrastructure.

The research paper (#999) was accepted for the **6th Summit on New Media Art Archiving, ISEA2026 Dubai**. The paper is at `docs/ARCHAI_ISEA2026_Rob_Graham.pdf`. A post-submission update covering June 2026 developments is at `docs/ARCHAI_ISEA2026_UPDATE_2026-06.md`.

## Research Context

**Investigator:** Rob Graham  
**Institution:** RMIT University, School of Design — PhD Researcher (DR235)

**Supervisors:** Chris Barker (Senior), co-supervisor TBC

ARCHAI is a practice-based doctoral research project. In practice-based research, building constitutes the research — not as illustration of theory, but as the primary epistemic act. The commit history of this repository is part of the methodology. The prototype iterations are documented findings. The code advances arguments that the writing must then sustain.

The research draws on a lineage extending from the Greek method of loci (Simonides, Cicero, Quintilian) through Renaissance rhetorical prosopopoeia to contemporary AI data art (Anadol, Ernst, Kirschenbaum). ARCHAI proposes a specific inversion of the classical memory palace technique: where in the original, a human uses architecture as a mnemonic device for knowledge held internally, ARCHAI uses AI to externalise the building's knowledge to visitors moving through it. Each NFC tag is a locus. Each collection object is its own bounded epistemic domain. The visitor retains nothing artificially; the building has already done the remembering, and it speaks.

## What ARCHAI Does

**Conversational collection access** — visitors hold natural language conversations with individual objects via NFC tap or QR scan. Each object speaks from its own curatorially-validated metadata record, with explicit epistemic boundaries. A five-layer hallucination prevention framework ensures responses remain grounded in verified curatorial fact.

**Sovereign infrastructure** — all AI inference (Ollama / qwen2.5:32b), vector search (Qdrant), and data processing runs locally. No visitor query, no object record, and no institutional data is transmitted to third-party cloud services.

**Cross-institutional semantic search** — nomic-embed-text embeddings (768-dimension) index the current 3,147-record pilot corpus across international museum, gallery, open-data, and digital-culture sources. Queries are natural language; results are merged by cosine similarity across all collections.

**Physical deployment** — a five-format downloadable artefact system (A4, A2, A0, postcard, sticker) generated client-side via Canvas API. Each format embeds a QR code linking to the live AUX.IO conversation page, a IIIF-sourced image from the originating institution, and full attribution. Museum objects enter public space — paste-up, zine, mural companion — while remaining connected to a live conversational interface.

**Rights-aware harvesting** — every object in the system has passed a per-item legal gate at harvest time. Licence status (CC0, CC BY, metadata-only, open government) is enforced in code, not configuration, and surfaced on every object page. No image is displayed on a public ARCHAI or AUX.IO surface without having passed that gate.

## Collection Status — June 2026

20 live collections/data sources · 3,147+ current records · 1,402 public AUX.IO visitor pages generated

ARCHAI is currently a draft institutional demo / WIP build. The current strongest testing lanes are semantic collection search, object review, AUX.IO publishing, rights-aware media, IIIF viewing, and browser voice access. Nodel/exhibition operations, FAMTEC Exchange, CMS/DAMS connector generalisation, and persistent project workspaces remain active development areas.

## Core Technical Contributions

Twelve interconnected contributions characterise the research:

1. **Vector embeddings for heritage discovery** — semantic search across heterogeneous collections without reliance on controlled curatorial vocabulary.
2. **Provenance-tracked AI interpretation** — every generated response records its complete derivation chain back to source materials.
3. **Two-layer architecture** — permanent heritage assets held separately from regenerable AI processing layers. The heritage foundation is never modified by AI.
4. **Conversational objects** — individual collection items speaking to visitors from their own validated metadata, via NFC tap or QR scan.
5. **Five-layer hallucination prevention** — structured metadata schemas, AI epistemic constraints, real-time validation, human curator sign-off, and post-launch monitoring.
6. **Transferable hardware reference implementation** — a sovereign, scalable open-source stack adaptable to institutions of varying size. Total capital investment: approximately AUD 10,000–20,000 one-time; no subscriptions.
7. **Cross-institutional open data pipeline** — automated harvesting from international museum, gallery, open-data, and digital-culture sources with per-source licence verification, IIIF integration, and legal gate enforcement at point of ingest.
8. **Physical deployment layer** — five-format downloadable artefact system (A4/A2/A0/postcard/sticker) generated client-side via Canvas API, enabling museum objects to enter public space with live QR links back to conversational interfaces.
9. **Multilingual audio interface** — voice input (Whisper, local), voice output (Coqui TTS), extending conversational access across languages and interaction modalities.
10. **Multi-category public cultural data integration** — municipal open data (street and public art, six cities) and interactive digital culture (RAWG games) integrated under identical licence-gate enforcement as institutional museum collections.
11. **Thematic discovery navigation** — disciplinary group tabs with per-institution sub-tabs across the current 3,147-record corpus, enabling cross-collection discovery without controlled vocabulary dependency.
12. **Legal gate enforcement at scale** — per-source rights verification documented in a collection-targets matrix, implemented in harvester code, and surfaced on every public object page.

## AUX.IO — Visitor Interface

AUX.IO (from Latin *aux*, voice) is the public-facing visitor interface: a per-object conversation page deployable via NFC tag, QR code, hyperlink, or Bluetooth beacon. Each page is a self-contained static HTML file embedding the object's complete metadata and AI context. No app is required; no login is needed; no data is collected from the visitor.

From any AUX.IO page, a visitor may:
- hold a natural language conversation with the object (grounded in its verified record)
- select a response style: Guide / Curatorial / Learning / Interpretive
- use voice input and audio response (browser SpeechRecognition + SpeechSynthesis; Whisper/Coqui in development)
- download a print-ready poster in five formats
- share the page, copy the link, or post directly
- submit a response that joins the collection record (curator-reviewed before publication)
- navigate to related objects across the current live collection set

The open call **#ARCHAIinTheWild** invites communities — street artists, collectives, educators, zine makers — to take AUX.IO posters into public space. Every poster embeds a QR code that connects back to the live conversational interface.

## Origin and Research Independence

The conceptual foundations of ARCHAI were developed over more than twenty years of professional practice across museums, galleries, and cultural institutions — including ACMI, TarraWarra Museum of Art, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Museums Victoria, Grande Experiences, and the National Communication Museum. All theoretical frameworks, design principles, and research questions emerged from this accumulated practitioner experience, and are entirely independent of any single institution or employer.

All code in this repository was written after departing the National Communication Museum, developed independently through FAMTEC as part of doctoral research at RMIT University, School of Design. The first version committed to this repository (v6, the `v0.1-alpha` release) was the first working prototype, built from the updated PhD research document and the ISEA2026 white paper. Earlier conceptual iterations (v1–v4) existed as planning documents and AI-assisted conversation prototypes during the research design phase — the ideas that informed them are documented in the PhD drafts and the ARCHAI Master Plan.

This repository, its commit history, and its git log constitute a verifiable, timestamped research journal of the entire development process, establishing clear provenance for all code, design decisions, and research outputs.
